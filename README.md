**Note:**
- The Notebook included in this repository is taken from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The main reason I have included this Notebook in my repositoy is that I found this Project really interesting. In this Project KNeighborsClassifier is used to classify weather a patient is suffering from Malignant or Benign. I myself was very excited to do this Project as a part of Assignment in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). Hope you will enjoy too and gain some useful insights.
